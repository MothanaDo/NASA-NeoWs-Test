##  üåç NEO Data Visualization App
This project is a web application that visualizes Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) from NASA's NeoWs (Near Earth Object Web Service) API. It allows users to filter NEO data, visualize the diameters of objects in a bar chart, switch to a table view, and download the data as CSV.

## üåê Live Demo
You can view a live demo of the application [here](https://nasa-neo-ws-test-vggc.vercel.app/).

## üöÄ Features
- NEO Data Fetching: Fetches data from NASA's NeoWs API.
- Bar Chart Visualization: Displays NEO min and max diameters in a bar chart sorted by average diameter.
- Table View: Displays NEO data in a table format with sorting and filtering options.
- Search Functionality: Allows users to search NEOs by name.
- Dropdown Filter: Filters NEOs based on the selected orbital body.
- View Switcher: Easily switch between table view and chart view.
- CSV Download: Download the table data as a CSV file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- React with Vite for fast development
- TypeScript for static typing
- Tailwind CSS for professional and responsive styling
- Recharts for data visualization
- MUI (Material UI) for form components (dropdown, etc.)
- NASA NeoWs API for real-time NEO data
